You will be able to select locations for making a community garden, post your land as available to people to use or vote on the best locations. If you have too many tomatoes, you can post them here too.\r\n\r\nWe are just starting with this project, it will be open source, hosted on github. We will put as much as possible unhosted on the browser. Some things will be run on different free hosting sites in the backend.\r\n\r\nIf you want to know more, sign up on our [announcement mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/local-organic-food-announce) and we will mail you with updates.","google":"UA-53428874-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
